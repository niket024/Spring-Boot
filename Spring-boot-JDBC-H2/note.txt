ApplicationRunner
-------------------
When you want to execute some piece of code exactly before the application startup completes, you can use it then.

CrudRepository
--------------
Spring Boot Data enables JPA repository support by default.
 CrudRepository provides generic CRUD operation on a repository for a specific type. 
 CrudRepository is a Spring data interface and to use it we need to create our interface by extending CrudRepository. 
 Spring provides CrudRepository implementation class automatically at runtime. It contains methods such as save, findById, delete, count etc. 
 Spring boot automatically detects our repository 
 if the package of that repository interface is the same or sub-package of the class annotated with @SpringBootApplication.

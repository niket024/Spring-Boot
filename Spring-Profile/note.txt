What Is A Profile?
------------------------
When we create an application, we need to deploy it in different kinds of environments,
such as development, QA, staging and production.

The application configuration in each of these environments will be different.

One of the approaches to handling application configuration is to create something called a profile.
Spring Boot has the concept of a profile built in.

Spring Boot Profiles
---------------------
You can define default configuration in application.properties. 
Environment specific overrides can be configured in specific files:
eg.
application-dev.properties
application-test.properties
application-stage.properties
application-prod.properties

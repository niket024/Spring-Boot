HATEOAS
---------
Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) 
is a component of the REST application architecture that 
distinguishes it from other network application architectures. 
With HATEOAS, a client interacts with a network 
application whose application servers provide information dynamically through hypermedia.

Generally speaking, the principle implies that the API should guide 
the client through the application by returning relevant information about the next potential steps, 
along with each response.

Step 1:
-------
Extend resource models with ResourceSupport class
Extend all model classes where you want to add HATEOAS links – 
with org.springframework.hateoas.ResourceSupport class.

Step 2:

Build and add links in REST controller
To add links, you will need ControllerLinkBuilder and Link classes. 
Link is the final representation of link to be added in REST resource. 
Whereas ControllerLinkBuilder 
helps in building the links using it’s various method based on builder pattern.
